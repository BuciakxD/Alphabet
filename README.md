# Alphabet
Some electronic devices allow text entry using a grid of letters. The grid contains a movable cursor, which begins in the upper-left hand corner. The arrow keys move the cursor up, down, left and right. The Enter key chooses the letter under the cursor.
Write a program which for a given grid (which may contain both lowercase and uppercase letters) and text (which may also contain non-alphabetic characters) determines and writes out the minimum number of keystrokes required to enter the given text.
